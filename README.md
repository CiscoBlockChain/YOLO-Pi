# YOLO-Pi: Real Time Object Recognition on Raspberry Pi

The purpose of this project is to attach a USB camera to a Raspberri Pi and then automatically detect objects that the camera sees.  

To do this we take [yolo](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/) weigts and configuration and run it through [yad2k](https://github.com/allanzelener/YAD2K).  This in turn generates a [keras](https://keras.io/) model.  With the keras model we modify the test_yolo code from the yad2k project and add in opencv3 so we can get the camera real time.  

## Using existing Models

Grab weights and config file from main [YOLO site.](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/)

Use tiny-yolo-voc as this seems to be supported. Once you get the weights and the config run it through yad2k to create the tiny-yolo-voc.h5

```
./yad2k.py tiny-yolo-voc.cfg tiny-yolo-voc.weights model_data/tiny-yolo-voc.h5
```
Now we have the ```tiny-yolo-voc.h5```

I've simplified the ```yolo-pi.py``` script by not taking in command line arguments.  Instead you can just change a few lines that look like the below:

```python
model_path = 'model_data/tiny-yolo-voc.h5'
anchors_path = 'model_data/tiny-yolo-voc_anchors.txt'
classes_path = 'model_data/pascal_classes.txt'
```

Running the ```yolo-pi.py``` will give you output like the following:

As you can tell from the picture above the voc model is not super accurate but its pretty fast generating about 1 frame ever 2 seconds on a macbook pro. 

## Installation Notes
Installation sucks.  

```<python rant>``` 
While Python is super easy to write code it is extremely difficult to get the environment for the code to run in work.

Presently working to make this eaiser.  Basically you need: 

* [x] Python 3 (we use anaconda)
* [x] OpenCV 3.0.0 (3.1 has bugs on Mac and crashes)
* [x] Keras
* [x] Pillow
* [x] Tensorflow
* [x] NumPy
 
opencv3 3.0.0 we installed using:

```
conda install -c jlaura opencv3
```
You could use 3.1.1 from the meno repo but it crashes, so we stick with 3.0.0 for now.
